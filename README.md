# 🕵️‍♂️ Network Scanner Project

A simple Python-based network scanner that detects live hosts and scans open ports in a specified subnet or IP address.

## 🔧 Features
- Host discovery using DNS resolution
- Port scanning for common ports (22, 80, 443, etc.)
- Multi-threaded for faster scanning
- Built using Python's standard `socket` library

## 📌 Example Output
[✓] Host active: 192.168.1.7
[→] 192.168.1.7 has open ports: [80, 443]
## 📜 Requirements
- Python 3.x

## 🏁 How to Run
```bash
python network_scanner.py
